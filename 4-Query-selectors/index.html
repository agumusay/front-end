      <img src="https://picsum.photos/300/300" />
      <p>
        Swartz was born in
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_Park,_Illinois" target
          >Highland Park, Illinois</a
        >[2][19] (a suburb of Chicago), the eldest son of Jewish parents Susan
        and Robert Swartz and brother of Noah and Benjamin.[1][20] His father
        had founded the software firm Mark Williams Company. Swartz immersed
        himself in the study of computers, programming, the Internet, and
        Internet culture.[21] He attended North Shore Country Day School, a
        small private school near Chicago, until 9th grade.[22] Swartz left high
        school in the 10th grade, and enrolled in courses at a Chicago area
        college.[23][24]
      </p>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/600/300" alt="" />
      <p>
        In 1999, when he was 13 years old he created the website Theinfo.org, a
        collaborative online library.[25] Theinfo.org made Swartz the winner of
        the ArsDigita Prize, given to young people who create "useful,
        educational, and collaborative" noncommercial websites.[1][26][27] At
        age 14, he became a member of the working group that authored the RSS
        1.0 web syndication specification. Swartz attended Stanford University,
        but dropped out after his first year.[28]

        In 2008, Swartz founded Watchdog.net, "the good government site with
        teeth," to aggregate and visualize data about politicians.[36][37] In
        the same year, he wrote a widely circulated
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#Open_Access"
          >Guerilla Open Access Manifesto</a
        >.[38][39][40][41] On December 27, 2010, Swartz filed a Freedom of
        Information Act (FOIA) request to learn about the treatment of Chelsea
        Manning, alleged source for WikiLeaks.[42][43]

        United States v. Aaron Swartz case
      </h2>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/200/400" alt="" />
      <p>
        Aaron Swartz noted that the knowledge produced at public universities
        and financed by the US government and graduate students was not released
        free to the public. Instead, it was being copyrighted and benefits were
        not given to the authors but were being privatized and locked by
        for-profit corporations that did not invest in these public works. They
        instead earned billions of US dollars each year for private publishers,
        since these publications were repackaged in academic databases that
        university libraries pay thousands of dollars to subscribe to so that
        their students can access the content. Swartz used a full text scholarly
        online database, JSTOR, which he accessed through the MIT network in
        order to download books, journals, etc. produced thanks to public funds
        and paid for by money collected by taxpayers.
      </p>

      <p>
        According to state and federal authorities, Swartz used JSTOR, a
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_repository"
          target="blank"
          >digital repository</a
        >,[68] to download a large number[ii] of academic journal articles
        through MIT's computer network over the course of a few weeks in late
        2010 and early 2011. At the time, Swartz was a research fellow at
        Harvard University, which provided him with a JSTOR account.[13]
        Visitors to MIT's "open campus" were authorized to access JSTOR through
        its network.[69]
      </p>

      <p>
        The authorities said Swartz downloaded the documents through a laptop
        connected to a networking switch in a controlled-access wiring closet at
        MIT.[12][13][70][71][72] The door to the closet was kept unlocked,
        according to press reports.[69][73][74] When discovered, a video camera
        was placed in the room to film Swartz and his computer was left
        untouched. Once video of Swartz was recorded, the download was stopped
        and he was identified. Rather than pursue a civil lawsuit against him,
        in June 2011 they reached a settlement wherein he surrendered the
        downloaded data.[75][76]

      <p>
        On the evening of January 11, 2013, Swartz's girlfriend,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taren_Stinebrickner-Kauffman"
          >Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman</a
        >, found him dead in his Brooklyn apartment.[69][102][103][104] A
        spokeswoman for New York's Medical Examiner reported that he had hanged
        himself.[103][104][105][106] No
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_note" target="_blank"
          >suicide note</a
        >
        was found.[107] Swartz's family and his partner created a memorial
        website on which they issued a statement, saying: "He used his
        prodigious skills as a programmer and technologist not to enrich himself
        but to make the Internet and the world a fairer, better place."[20]
      </p>
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/200/300" alt="" />
      <p>
        Days before Swartz's funeral, Lawrence Lessig eulogized his friend and
        sometime-client in an essay, Prosecutor as Bully. He decried the
        disproportionality of Swartz's prosecution and said, "The question this
        government needs to answer is why it was so necessary that Aaron Swartz
        be labeled a 'felon'. For in the 18 months of negotiations, that was
        what he was not willing to accept."[108] Cory Doctorow wrote, "Aaron had
        an unbeatable combination of political insight, technical skill, and
        intelligence about people and issues. I think he could have
        revolutionized American (and worldwide) politics. His legacy may still
        yet do so."[109]

      <p>
        On January 12, 2013, Swartz's family and partner issued a statement
        criticizing the prosecutors and MIT.[126] Speaking at his son's funeral
        on January 15, Robert Swartz said, "Aaron was killed by the government,
        and MIT betrayed all of its basic principles."[127]

      <p>
        Tom Dolan, husband of U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_Ortiz">Carmen Ortiz</a>,
        whose office prosecuted Swartz's case, replied with criticism of the
        Swartz family: "Truly incredible that in their own son's obit they blame
        others for his death and make no mention of the 6-month offer."[128]
        This comment triggered some criticism; Esquire writer
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Pierce"
          >Charlie Pierce</a
        >
        replied, "the glibness with which her husband and her defenders toss off
        a 'mere' six months in federal prison, low-security or not, is a further
        indication that something is seriously out of whack with the way our
        prosecutors think these days."

        Supporters of Swartz responded to news of his death with an effort
        called #PDFTribute[175] to promote Open Access.[176][177] On January 12,
        Eva Vivalt, a development economist at the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank" target="_self"
          >World Bank</a
        >, began posting her academic articles online using the hashtag
        #pdftribute as a tribute to Swartz.[177][178][179] Scholars posted links
        to their works.[180] The story of Aaron Swartz has exposed the topic of
        open access to scientific publications to wider audiences.[181][182] In
        the wake of Aaron Swartz, many institutions and personalities have
        campaigned for open access to scientific knowledge.[183] Swartz's death
        prompted calls for more open access to scholarly data (e.g.,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science_data"
          >open science data</a
        >).[184][185] The Think Computer Foundation and the Center for
        Information Technology Policy (CITP) at Princeton University announced
        scholarships awarded in memory of Aaron Swartz.[186] In 2013, Swartz was
        posthumously awarded the American Library Association's James Madison
        Award for being an "outspoken advocate for public participation in
        government and unrestricted access to peer-reviewed scholarly
        articles."[187][188] In March, the editor and editorial board of the
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_of_Library_Administration"
          >Journal of Library Administration</a
        >
        resigned en masse, citing a dispute with the journal's publisher,
        Routledge.[189] One board member wrote of a "crisis of conscience about
        publishing in a journal that was not open access" after the death of
        Aaron Swartz.[190][191] In 2002, Swartz had stated that when he died, he
        wanted all the contents of his hard drives made publicly
        available.[192][193] The "cOAlition S", a consortium launched by the
        European Research Council continues the fight of Aaron Swartz with the
        will to make available to all by 2020 all the scientific publications
        financed by the member states of this coalition.[194]

        Swartz has been featured in and received dedications from numerous art
        work. In 2013, Kenneth Goldsmith dedicated his "Printing out the
        Internet" exhibition to Swartz.[222][223] The fate of Aaron Swartz was
        also featured in conservative filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza's 2014
        documentary America: Imagine the World Without Her, wherein D'Souza
        compares Swartz's prosecution to his own conviction for violating
        campaign finance laws, and alleges that both cases exemplify selective,
        overzealous prosecution.
