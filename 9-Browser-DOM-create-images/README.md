# Create images

There is a few images in the `images` folder.


1. Select one image, create an image element, then add it to the document.


2. Select one image at random, create an image element, then add it to the document.

Next, update the styles via JavaScript, so the image does not 
stretch more than the browser window.

Extra: you could use[ `setInterval`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval) to change the images every second or two.

Extra: can you add a title to each image and display it below the image?
