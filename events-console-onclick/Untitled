# Adding and removing event handlers

Add an event listener to a button.
The click handler should print to the console the element that was clicked and its inner text.

Extra (Option 1): After 5 seconds remove the event listener. Now on click, nothing should be printed to the console.

Extra (Option 2): Add a second button that when clicked removes the event listener from the 1st button.
